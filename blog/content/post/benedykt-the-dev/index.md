## What is Benedykt-the-Dev?

**Benedykt-the-Dev** is my **personal website** where I share my **portfolio**, **skills**, and **blog posts** about my experiences and interests. I built this project using **Next.js** along with a few smaller libraries, which I'll talk about in a moment. The blog itself is powered by **Hugo**, ensuring fast performance and great SEO optimization.

I have to admit, my inspiration for this project came from [Maciej](https://kaszkowiak.org/). I always read his posts with curiosity, and they ultimately motivated me to create my own site.

Honestly, a year ago, I wouldn't have guessed that I'd be writing a blog post about my own website. I hope that a year from now, I'll look back with the same sense of reflection – but this time about something completely different that I can't even imagine right now.

## What's on the website?
- **Portfolio** – A showcase of my key projects with links to related blog posts, my career journey, interests, and a way to get in touch.
- **Blog** – A place where I share my thoughts, tutorials, and experiences from my life as a developer.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – A frontend framework that works great with SEO and ensures fast performance thanks to server-side rendering (SSR). It also makes it easy to add new features, like a contact form, in the future.
- **Framer Motion** – My first experience with this animation library. It’s very intuitive and helps minimize unnecessary code.
- **React Typist** – I used this tool to create a typing effect on the screen. It’s lightweight and easy to implement – exactly what I needed.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework that allows for consistent and modern styling without the need for separate CSS files. I love how it lets me write components and styles in one place.
- **Hugo** – The blog is powered by **Hugo**, which guarantees fast loading times and excellent SEO optimization. At first, I ambitiously planned to write everything from scratch, including the backend and CMS. However, I ultimately chose **Hugo**, which allowed me to start publishing blog posts much faster. This choice was also inspired by [Maciej](https://kaszkowiak.org/), who recommended this solution.

## What's next?
This project was a great opportunity to **showcase my skills** and **share knowledge** about web development, AI, and other topics that interest me. I’m planning to expand the site with a section about my hobbies and education.

But let’s be real – the next few months are going to be pretty intense, because in just a week, I’m starting a **new part-time job (3/4 time)** and **Master's degree in AI**. Pressure? Sure, but they say it’s a privilege – so I’m planning to make the most of it. One thing’s for sure: boredom is not on the agenda!
