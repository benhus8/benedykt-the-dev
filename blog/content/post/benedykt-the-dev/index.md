## What is Benedykt-the-Dev?

**Benedykt-the-Dev** is a personal website showcasing my **portfolio**, **skills**, and **blog posts** related to my experiences and interests. It is built with **Next.js** along with several smaller libraries, which I’ll discuss later. The blog is powered by **Hugo**, ensuring fast performance and excellent SEO support.

I would be lying if I said that the inspiration for this project didn't come from [Maciej](https://kaszkowiak.org/). I read his posts with great curiosity, and they largely inspired me to create my own site.

Looking back a year, I would never have guessed that I'd be writing a blog post about my own website. I sincerely hope this trend continues, and that a year from now, I'll be thinking the same way – but about something I currently have no idea about.

## Project Components
- **Portfolio** – Showcasing key projects with links to blog posts, career milestones, interests, and contact information.
- **Blog** – Sharing insights, tutorials, and experiences from my journey as a developer.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – A frontend framework that is SEO-friendly and provides fast performance through server-side rendering (SSR). In the future, it will also allow me to easily implement features like email sending.
- **Framer Motion** – A delightful animation library, and this was my first experience using it. The solutions are intuitive and help reduce a lot of boilerplate code.
- **React Typist** – A lightweight and straightforward library for creating typing effects. It’s easy to use and does exactly what I need.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework that enables custom styling while maintaining visual consistency. I absolutely love this solution because it allows me to create styles and components in one place.
- **Hugo** – For the blog, I used the open-source project Hugo. It offers excellent performance and SEO support. At one point, I had the crazy idea of writing everything from scratch, including the backend and CMS, but ultimately, I chose to use this ready-made solution recommended by [Maciej](https://kaszkowiak.org/). My goal was to be able to write blog posts before March 2025, and building an entire system from scratch wouldn’t have allowed that.

## What's Next?
This project was an opportunity to **showcase my skills** and **share knowledge** in web development, AI, and other interests. In the future, I’d like to add sections about hobbies or education.

For now, it doesn’t look like this will happen anytime soon because, as I write this post, I know that in a week I will start a **new job at 3/4 time** and **Master's degree in AI**. They say pressure is a privilege, and that’s exactly how I see it. I certainly won’t be bored :).
