## Our Engineering Project – Is This the Future of Marketing?

This project was developed by a four-person team as our **engineering thesis**. It was a huge challenge for us, but at the same time, an incredible adventure that allowed us to combine creativity with modern technology.

As I write this post, I feel proud of what we’ve accomplished. On the other hand, there are some limitations, which I'll explain in a moment. But first, let’s talk about **what we managed to create** and why we believe it could be one of the future directions for marketing.

## What is this engineering project about?

In short – together with OLX, we set out to create a tool that allows companies to **quickly and easily generate advertising banners** without the need to hire a team of graphic designers. This is made possible by using **artificial intelligence algorithms** that automate the design process.

Just think about it – how many times have you seen repetitive, boring ads that passed by unnoticed? Or how many companies give up on advertising campaigns due to the cost of hiring professional designers? These are exactly the problems we aimed to solve by creating a **banner generator platform**.

### How does it work?
Without getting too technical – the system uses **generative AI** solutions to create unique and visually appealing banners based on user preferences. The user can choose from three different types of banners, add their logo, set dominant colors, and even generate a catchy slogan. **The whole process takes just a few minutes**!

### Why can't I reveal everything... yet
And now we get to the most interesting (and somewhat frustrating) part. At this stage, I can’t go into technical details or show exactly how the system works. Why? Simply because **the copyright situation is still unclear**. The project has sparked interest and... that’s all I can say for now, as I don’t want to jinx anything.

## What's next?
This post isn’t overly detailed, but **I plan to expand it in the future** with technical insights. I’d like to explain how we managed to integrate AI with a seemingly creative process like graphic design. For now, I need to be patient and wait to see how things develop regarding the potential acquisition of the project.

One thing is certain – this engineering project was a challenge but also an opportunity for growth and learning new tools. Regardless of what the future holds, I am already proud of what we have achieved. And if everything goes as planned... who knows, maybe one day you’ll see the results of our work on **OLX** banners?
