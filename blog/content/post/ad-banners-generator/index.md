## How My Engineering Thesis Could Revolutionize Marketing (But Let's Keep It Quiet for Now...)
First off, let me mention that this project was developed in a team of four, and I know that without them, the whole project wouldn't have reached such a satisfying level. So even though I'm using first-person narration, I'm always referring to the efforts of our team of four.

Writing this post brings up some mixed feelings. On the one hand, I want to share every detail of my **engineering thesis project** because I’m genuinely proud of it. On the other hand, there are some constraints, which I'll explain in a moment. But let's start with **what we managed to create** and why I believe it could have a significant impact on the world of marketing.

### What's the Deal with This Engineering Thesis?

In short – my (and my team's) goal was to create a tool that allows companies to design **ad banners** quickly, easily, and without the need to hire an entire team of graphic designers. This is made possible through the use of **artificial intelligence algorithms** that automate the design process.

Think about it – how many times have you seen boring, repetitive ads that just flew by without even catching your attention? Or how many companies give up on advertising campaigns because they can't afford professional graphic designers? These are precisely the problems we aimed to solve by creating a **system that generates ad banners**.

### How Does It Work?
Without diving too deep into technical details – the system uses **generative AI** to create unique and visually appealing banners based on user preferences. The user can choose from three available banner types, add their logo, set dominant colors, and even generate a catchy slogan. **The entire process takes just a few minutes**!

### Why I Can't Reveal Everything... Yet
And here we come to the most interesting (and somewhat frustrating) part. At this point, I can't go into technical details or show you exactly how the system works. Why? Well, it's because **the intellectual property rights are still up in the air**. The project has sparked some interest and... it might even be **acquired by OLX**. That would be quite the story, wouldn't it? But for now, nothing is certain, so I don’t want to jinx it.

## What's Next?
This isn't meant to be a comprehensive post, but **I plan to expand it in the future** with technical details and maybe even a case study. I want to share how we managed to integrate artificial intelligence into such a seemingly creative process as graphic design. For now, though, I have to be patient and wait to see how things pan out with the potential acquisition.

One thing's for sure – this engineering thesis was a huge challenge and an incredible adventure for me. Regardless of what the future holds, I'm already proud of what we've accomplished. And if everything goes as planned... who knows, maybe someday you'll see the results of our work on **OLX** banners?
