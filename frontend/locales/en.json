    "intro": "I am passionate about technology and love experimenting with new solutions. I invest my free time in expanding my IT knowledge because I believe continuous skill improvement is key to success in this dynamic industry. I am fascinated by creating modern applications and exploring the possibilities offered by programming and artificial intelligence. Here are some of the areas that inspire me the most and in which I constantly develop myself.",

      "backend": {
        "name": "Backend",
        "description": "I love backend – it’s my passion, and this is where I feel most comfortable. In my work, I mainly used Java and Python for implementing server applications and services. I developed microservices using frameworks like Spring Boot and FastAPI, and for integrating services, I had the opportunity to use messaging systems like RabbitMQ. I always strive to write code that not only works but is also SOLID, well-thought-out, and clean."

      "frontend": {
        "name": "Frontend",
        "description": "Although backend is my forte, I have had the opportunity to work with React and Next.js, and I really enjoyed it. I like experimenting with server-side rendering and new technologies in the React ecosystem. Creating modern interfaces is an exciting challenge for me, and optimizing frontend performance or adding a stunning view brings me great satisfaction. In my individual projects, I experiment with UI design using Figma. It was thanks to Figma that the design of this website, which you're currently viewing, was created."

        "name": "AI",
        "description": "Artificial intelligence truly excites me. For my engineering thesis, I created an advertising banner generation application with my team, utilizing GPT and DALL·E from OpenAI and AWS Bedrock. I am passionate about projects that combine the use of LLMs, backend, and frontend technologies because they allow me to merge my passions and create something truly remarkable. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, and I believe that my studies will allow me to further explore this branch of IT."

        "description": "Optimizing software deployment processes brings me great satisfaction. I love working with Docker and creating scalable applications that run smoothly in production environments. I have experience with AWS (S3, Cognito, EC2), and I am fascinated by the potential of cloud computing. I want to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in cloud solutions because I believe it is the future of modern applications. I enjoy when everything runs smoothly and without downtime – that’s when I feel my work truly matters."
